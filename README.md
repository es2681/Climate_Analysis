Based on temperature, it appears that it would be sustainable to operate a surf and ice cream shop year-round in Oahu. The temperature remains warm during both these months. However, before making any final determinations, it would be advisable to also analyze precipitation and windspeed data during these months. For example, this venture may be worth reconsidering in a storm- or hurricane-prone region.
